				<p>At least that's what my friends like to call me. Partially because it's my name, but also
					because
					I'm
					the
					Guy that does the thing that you need to do:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Need a clean, memorable front page for your website? - I've got you covered.</li>
					<li>Visuals a little out of date and need modernizing? - I'm on it.</li>
					<li>Miscellaneous design work that wasn't in the job description? - No problem.
					</li>
					<li>Need someone lively, handsome, and funny to boost morale? - I'm your Guy.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I spent years studying design before delving into development. That
					means my
					expertise doesn't just end at making you a website; <u>it ends at making you a really <i>cool</i> looking website.</u> A website is more than just code.
					You need a UI that is adaptable, interesting, and most of all nice to
					use, plus a uniform visual framework for use in emails, ads, and other communication.
					Whatever it is you need, <u>I'm the Guy for it.</u></p>
